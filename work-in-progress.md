Issues to Fix:
Login password: Change to "0208" ✓
Login redirect bug: After clicking login, it doesn't navigate to the dialer automatically - requires manual refresh ✓
OK codes: Need clarification - what should the OK codes be for:
Gatekeeper? (currently what?)
Decision-maker? (currently what?)
Feature Requests:
Sequence daily activities: You're asking if when you complete a daily activity for a contact in a sequence, will the next activity for that same contact automatically load the following day? (Want to confirm this is the question)

Cold calls filtering: Only show contacts that have NEVER been added to any sequence - once a contact gets added to a sequence, they should disappear from the cold calls list forever ✓

Contact database as CRM: You want to be able to click on any contact in the contact database and view/edit all their information ✓

Meeting widget reminder: Noted - this is planned for phase 2/3 where cold calls adjust based on meetings scheduled that day ✓

View expansion: Change the default view to show only 3 contacts at a time (for both cold calls and sequences), with an "expand" or "load more" option to see more ✓

Questions before implementing:
What should the OK codes be? Please tell me what you want for gatekeeper and decision-maker
View expansion: When you say "see 3 and then expand" - do you want a "Load More" button, infinite scroll, or a toggle to show all?
Sequence daily activities: Can you clarify this question? Are you asking how the system currently works, or requesting a specific behavior?
