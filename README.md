## 💾 Data Storage

**Phase 5: Cloud Storage (ACTIVE!)**

In production (on Netlify):
- ☁️ Data stored in Netlify Blob Storage
- 🔄 Automatic sync across all your devices
- 💾 Secure cloud backups
- 🚀 Automatic migration from localStorage on first load
- 🌐 Access from anywhere

In development (localhost):
- 🏠 Uses browser localStorage for faster development
- 📁 Data persists between sessions
- ⚡ No network latency

**Migration Notes:**
- First time you load the app in production, it automatically migrates your localStorage data to the cloud
- LocalStorage is kept as a backup in production
- Zero configuration needed - works automatically when deployed to Netlify!

## 🎨 Customization

### Brand Colors

Edit `tailwind.config.js` to change colors:

```javascript
colors: {
  r7: {
    blue: '#1d4460',    // Primary brand color
    red: '#cf071d',     // Accent color
    light: '#f2f7f9',   // Light background
    dark: '#0f2430',    // Dark variant
  }
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Data Not Saving
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Clear cache and reload
- Try a different browser

### CSV Import Failed
- Ensure CSV format matches template
- Check for special characters
- Verify file encoding (UTF-8)

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## 📖 NEPQ Methodology

This dialer is built around the 7th Level NEPQ framework:

1. **Connection** 🤝 - Build rapport
2. **Situation** 📋 - Understand current state
3. **Problem Awareness** 🔍 - Uncover pain points (L1-L4)
4. **Solution Awareness** 💡 - Explore ideal criteria
5. **Consequence** ⚠️ - Show cost of inaction
6. **Commitment** 🤝 - Get agreement to proceed
7. **Presentation** 📊 - Demo/proposal

### Problem Discovery Levels (L1-L4)

The dialer tracks problem depth using the NEPQ framework:

- **L1: Obvious** - Surface wants/not wants ("We want faster processing")
- **L2: Common** - Lack of capabilities ("We're missing automation")
- **L3: Specific** - Quantified impact ("Costing us $50K/year in lost productivity")
- **L4: Mission Critical** - Cost of inaction ("If we don't fix this, we'll miss our annual targets")

**Phase 3 Complete!** Get AI-powered question suggestions based on your current phase and problem level, plus comprehensive analytics to optimize your NEPQ performance!
