**PROJECT:** Build R7 NEPQ Dialer - A sales calling system for cold prospecting

**CONTEXT:**
I'm building a web-based dialer for a sales prospector who follows Jeremy Miner's 7th Level NEPQ (Neuro-Emotional Persuasion Questioning) methodology. The system needs to help track calls, manage contacts, and guide conversations through the 7-phase NEPQ framework.

**TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS:**
- React + Vite (fast, modern)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
- LocalStorage (simple data persistence for now)
- Netlify deployment (one-click from GitHub)
- No complex database setup - keep it simple for a vibe coder

**WHAT I NEED YOU TO BUILD:**

**Phase 1: Foundation (Build This First)**
Create a complete, working React app with:

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Vite + React project structure
   - Tailwind CSS configured with custom R7 colors (blue: #1d4460, red: #cf071d, light: #f2f7f9)
   - Proper file organization (components/, lib/, hooks/)
   - netlify.toml for deployment
   - All necessary config files

2. **Core Components:**
   - **Dashboard** - Home screen showing contact count, stats, and "Start Calling" button
   - **CallingInterface** - Main calling screen with:
     - Contact card (name, phone, website)
     - "Call Now" button (tel: link)
     - Call outcome selector (No Answer / Gatekeeper / Decision Maker)
     - OK code dropdown (12 predefined codes)
     - Notes textarea
     - "Save & Next Contact" button
   
3. **Data Management:**
   - LocalStorage wrapper (simple get/set/remove functions)
   - Contact schema with: id, companyName, phone, website, callHistory[], dials, lastCall, okCode
   - CSV import/export functionality
   - Constants file with OK codes

4. **User Flow:**
   - Dashboard → Click "Start Calling" → CallingInterface
   - Loop through contacts one by one
   - Save call data → Auto-advance to next contact
   - Back to Dashboard when complete

**IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Make it FAST - minimal clicks, smooth flow
- Mobile-friendly UI (works on phone)
- Clean, professional design using Tailwind
- All data persists in localStorage
- Ready to deploy to Netlify immediately

**DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED:**
I'm attaching the complete documentation package (CLAUDE_CODE_PACKAGE.md) which includes:
- Full NEPQ methodology overview
- Complete data schemas
- Component architecture
- All code templates you need
- Implementation guidelines

**DELIVERABLES:**
1. Complete file structure with all files created
2. Working app that runs with `npm run dev`
3. README with setup instructions
4. Ready to push to GitHub and deploy on Netlify

**PHASES AFTER THIS:**
- Phase 2: Add NEPQ tracking (phases, problem levels)
- Phase 3: Add avatar system and question suggester
- Phase 4: Add analytics dashboard
- Phase 5: Migrate to Netlify Blob Storage

But RIGHT NOW, just build Phase 1 - a solid foundation that works perfectly.

**STYLE PREFERENCES:**
- Clean, modern UI
- Large, touch-friendly buttons
- Clear labels and instructions
- Use emojis for visual cues (📞, 💾, etc.)
- Professional but not stuffy

**START WITH:**
1. Set up the complete Vite + React + Tailwind project
2. Create all the core files (main.jsx, App.jsx, Dashboard.jsx, CallingInterface.jsx)
3. Implement the storage layer
4. Build the calling workflow
5. Test that it works end-to-end

Let's build a clean, working foundation first, then we'll add NEPQ intelligence in the next phase.

Ready? Let's go! 🚀

**ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:**
- User is "Jordan" - a solo sales prospector
- He dials 50-100 prospects per day
- Currently using Excel spreadsheets (inefficient)
- Trained in 7th Level NEPQ methodology
- Needs something simple that just works
- Will use Claude Code and Gemini to help maintain/extend it

**SUCCESS = Working dialer he can use TODAY, then enhance with NEPQ features later.**
