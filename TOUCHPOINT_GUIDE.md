# Touchpoint Guide

## What Are Touchpoints?

**Touchpoints** are strategic interactions with prospects designed to build familiarity, trust, and engagement over time. Each touchpoint is a planned contact through various channels to stay top-of-mind without being pushy.

The 7th Level Dialer uses a **30-day, 27-touch sequence** that combines multiple channels to create a persistent but professional outreach campaign.

---

## Why Multiple Touchpoints?

Research shows that:
- It takes 7-13+ touches to generate a qualified lead
- Multi-channel approaches increase response rates by 300%
- Consistent, spaced-out engagement builds trust better than aggressive bursts
- Different people prefer different communication channels

Our sequence ensures you're reaching prospects through their preferred channels while maintaining a professional cadence.

## Touchpoint Types Explained

### 📞 **1. Phone Calls (4 total)**

**What it is:** Direct phone call to the prospect's business line.

**When to use:** Days 1, 8, 15, 22 (weekly cadence)

**Best practices:**
- Always leave a professional voicemail if no answer
- Keep voicemails under 30 seconds
- Mention specific value proposition
- Include your callback number clearly
- Track voicemail separately from live conversations

**Why it works:** Phone calls are the highest-intent touchpoint. Even voicemails create brand familiarity and urgency.

---

### 📧 **2. Emails (6 total)**

**What it is:** Targeted email messages sent to the prospect's business email.

**When to use:** Days 1, 4, 8, 10, 15, 24

**Email sequence breakdown:**
1. **Email #1 (Day 1)** - "Quick Question" - Brief, curiosity-driven opener
2. **Email #2 (Day 4)** - "Value Bomb" - Share valuable insight or resource
3. **Email #3 (Day 8)** - "Social Proof" - Case study or testimonial
4. **Email #4 (Day 10)** - "Breakup Email" - "Should I stay or should I go?"
5. **Email #5 (Day 15)** - "Competitive Angle" - What they're missing vs competitors
6. **Email #6 (Day 24)** - "Free Resource" - Final valuable offer

**Best practices:**
- Keep subject lines under 50 characters
- Personalize with their name, company, or recent activity
- Include clear call-to-action
- A/B test different approaches
- Track open rates and clicks

**Why it works:** Emails allow you to educate, provide value, and stay in their inbox. Different messaging angles resonate with different personality types.

---

### 💼 **3. LinkedIn Direct Messages (2 total)**

**What it is:** Personal message sent through LinkedIn.

**When to use:** Days 2, 12

**Best practices:**
- Reference something specific from their profile
- Don't pitch immediately - build rapport first
- Keep it conversational, not salesy
- Mention mutual connections if applicable
- Respect LinkedIn's messaging limits

**Why it works:** LinkedIn is seen as a professional space. Messages here feel more credible than cold emails and allow you to leverage your professional network.

---

### 💬 **4. LinkedIn Comments (5 total)**

**What it is:** Thoughtful comment on one of their LinkedIn posts.

**When to use:** Days 5, 10, 14, 21, 26

**Best practices:**
- Add genuine insight, not just "Great post!"
- Ask thoughtful questions
- Share relevant experience
- Avoid promotional language
- Use emojis sparingly and professionally

**Why it works:** Public engagement positions you as a peer in their network. They'll see your name repeatedly in a positive context, building familiarity and credibility.

---

### 👍 **5. Social Media Engagement (4 total)**

**What it is:** React to and comment on their posts on platforms like Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, or TikTok.

**When to use:** Days 2, 6, 14, 19, 28

**Best practices:**
- Follow their accounts first (tracked separately on Day 2)
- Engage authentically based on content
- Avoid controversial topics
- Match the platform's tone (casual for Instagram, professional for Twitter)
- Mix reactions and comments

**Why it works:** Social media creates "ambient awareness" - they see your name in their notifications regularly, which builds subconscious trust and familiarity.

---

### 📬 **6. Physical Mail (1 total)**

**What it is:** Postcard or handwritten note sent via postal mail.

**When to use:** Day 19 (midpoint of sequence)

**Best practices:**
- Use eye-catching design or handwritten notes
- Include a clear call-to-action
- Reference previous touchpoints if appropriate
- Consider using a service like SendOutCards or Postable
- Track mailing to confirm delivery

**Why it works:** Physical mail stands out in a digital world. Only 1-2% of businesses use this tactic, so it creates a memorable "pattern interrupt" and shows extra effort.

| 📧 Emails | 6 | 1, 4, 8, 10, 15, 24 |

---

## Channel Availability

Not every prospect will have all channels available. The system automatically skips tasks when:
- No email address → Skip all email tasks
- No LinkedIn profile → Skip LinkedIn DMs and comments
- No social media → Skip social follows and engagements

This ensures you're only using channels where the prospect is actually reachable.

---

## Tracking Touchpoints

Each completed touchpoint updates the contact's engagement counters:
- `calls_made` - Total phone calls made
- `voicemails_left` - Voicemails left (subset of calls)
- `emails_sent` - Emails sent
- `linkedin_dms_sent` - LinkedIn DMs sent
- `linkedin_comments_made` - LinkedIn comments posted
- `social_reactions` - Social media likes/reactions
- `social_comments` - Social media comments
- `physical_mail_sent` - Postcard mailed (boolean)

These metrics help you understand:
- How many touches it typically takes to convert
- Which channels perform best
- Where prospects engage most
- When to mark a lead as dead

---

## When to Stop the Sequence

The sequence should be paused or stopped when:

1. **✅ Converted to Client** - They respond positively and become a customer
2. **❌ Marked as Dead** - No response after 30 days and all attempts exhausted
3. **⏸️ Requested Pause** - They ask for you to reach out later
4. **🚫 Unsubscribed** - They opt out or request no contact

Never continue outreach to someone who has explicitly asked to be removed.

---

## Best Practices for Success

### 1. **Personalize Every Touch**
- Reference their company, role, or recent activity
- Avoid generic templates
- Make each touch feel human

### 2. **Respect Rest Days**
- The built-in rest days prevent overwhelming prospects
- Use these days for research and preparation
- Never compress the sequence to speed it up

### 3. **Track Everything**
- Log every touchpoint completion immediately
- Add notes about responses or observations
- Use data to optimize future sequences

### 4. **Provide Value**
- Every email should educate or help
- LinkedIn comments should add insight
- Avoid pitchy, salesy language

### 5. **Be Patient**
- Some prospects need all 27 touches before responding
- Decision-makers are busy - persistence shows commitment
- Trust the process

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I change the sequence order?**
A: The sequence is optimized based on sales research, but you can customize `SEQUENCE_CALENDAR` in `/src/lib/sequenceCalendar.js` if needed.

**Q: What if they respond mid-sequence?**
A: Pause the sequence immediately and engage in conversation. Use the "Convert to Client" action if they become a customer.

**Q: Should I personalize every touchpoint?**
A: Yes! Templates are a starting point, but personalization dramatically increases response rates.

**Q: What if I don't have their LinkedIn or social media?**
A: The system automatically skips those tasks. Focus on the channels you do have access to.

**Q: How do I know when to mark someone dead?**
A: After completing the 30-day sequence with no response, it's reasonable to mark them as dead. Consider waiting 90 days before retrying.

**Remember:** Touchpoints are about building relationships, not just making sales. Treat every prospect with respect, provide genuine value, and trust that consistent, multi-channel engagement will yield results over time.
